  `A teacher asks the kids at class:
  "I want you to name things that have hair on it"
  "A cat!", the first kid says.
  "That's correct", teacher replies. "A cat has hair on it. Can anyone tell something else that has hair?"
  "An owl!", says another kid.
  The teacher said: "Sorry, an owl has feathers, not hair! Anyone else?"
  Other kid says: "Billiard balls!"
  Teacher: "No, no, no! Billiard balls surely don't have any hair"
  The kid says: "I am sure they have", and turns to the boy sitting behind him:
  "C'mon, Billiard, show your balls to the teacher!"`,

  `Sex is like playing billiards.
  You have a cue, you have balls, you have a hole
  and the important rule is that the white one must not go in.`,

  `I cleaned the billiard table with too much water.
  Now it is a swimming pool.`,

  `I hinted to my friend that if he wanted to improve his billiards game
  he should get better equipment. Sadly... he took my cue.`,

  `A man walks from the billiard table to the bartender in a pub.
  He says to the bartender with confidence:
  "I'd like to make a bet, that I can piss in a glass 5 meters across the room without spilling one drop!".
  The bartender laughs out loud and asks jokily:
  "Well how much will the bet be?" "500 euros", he shows the bartender the money and the bartender says "Deal!".
  The man unzips his pants and starts pissing, he pisses on the bar, on the chairs,
  on the ground and even on the bartender, everywhere except in the glass 5 meters across.
  The bartender and the man both laughing their asses off.
  Then the bartender asks the man: "Why are you laughing, you're 500 euro's poorer!"
  "Well, I just made a bet with that man at the billiard table,
  that I will piss on everything here and that you will just laugh about it for 750 euros!"`,

  `Why can't an autistic kid play billiards?
  He can't pick up cues.`,

  `How many pool players does it take to change a lightbulb?
  Five. One to change the bulb and four to stand around going "pffft, I can do that".`,

  `What does a medium pizza and a pro pool player have in common?
  Neither one can feed a family of 4.`,

  `"My stomach has been bothering me, Doctor" complained the patient.
  "What have you been eating?" asked the doctor.
  "That's easy. I only eat pool balls."
  "Pool balls?!" said the astonished doctor. "Maybe that's the trouble. What kind do you eat?"
  "All kinds," replied the man, "red ones for breakfast, yellow and orange ones for lunch,
  blue ones for afternoon snacks, and purple and black for dinner."
  "I see the problem," said the doctor. "You haven't been getting any greens...!"`,

  `Mick's wife was furiously humping away with her husbands best mate Peter, when suddenly the phone rang.
  She hopped out of bed and returned to the sweaty sheet after a brief conversation.
  "Who was it?" The back stabbing buddy asked.
  "Oh, that was Mick." She replied calmly.
  "Oh shit, I'd better be going then!" he said. "Did Mick say where he was?"
  "Relax - he's down at the pub, playing a few games of pool."`,

  `Why are police officers bad at billiards?
  They hit eight ball first because it is black.`,

  `"Dad, when I grow up, I want to be a pool player."
  "Son, you can't have it both."`,

  `Two guys are playing pool, when they notice a funeral procession passing by on the street in front of the pool hall.
  One of the players stops shooting, goes to the front window, takes off his hat,
  and stands respectfully silent until the procession is finished passing.
  The other player says, "well, that was nice of you to show your respect."
  His friend responds, "it was the least I could do, we were married for 30 years."`,

  `No es lo mismo una bola negra que una negra en bolas.`,

  `Where does a pool table keep its money?
  In its pockets.`,

  `Why are pool tables green?
  You'd be green too if you had your balls shot around like that...`,

  `What's green, fuzzy, and if it fell out of a tree it would kill you?
  A pool table.`,
