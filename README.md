### Extended Rules

These are standard billiard rules you can apply in HaxBall too if desired.

- Foul when you do not touch any ball of your team
- Foul when you touch first a ball of opponent's team
- Foul if you shot the ball when balls are still moving
- After scoring the white ball you must shot to the right, from the 1/4 left part of the table (kickoff area)
- Black, the last ball, must be scored in the opposite hole of your last scored ball. You lose scoring in another hole.
- You lose if you score both black and white balls with the same shot.
